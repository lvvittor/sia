# CMYK vs RGB color models

The CMYK model is better than the RGB model for mixing colors when it comes to printing or painting, because it is a subtractive color model. In the subtractive color model, when we mix colors, the result becomes darker because the pigments absorb more light.

In contrast, the RGB model is an additive color model, which is used in digital devices like computer screens and TVs. In the additive color model, when we mix colors, the result becomes brighter because the colors emit light.

Therefore, the CMYK model is more appropriate for mixing colors in printing or painting because it represents how the pigments interact with light. RGB is more appropriate for digital devices because it represents how light is emitted from a screen.
